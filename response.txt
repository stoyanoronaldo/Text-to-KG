Here is the representation of the concepts and relations between them in Turtle format, using RDFS schema, XML schema, and FHIR:

example:Depression
  a rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:label "Depression" ;
  rdfs:comment "A mental health disorder characterized by feelings of sadness and loss of interest in activities" ;
  fhir:code [ fhir:system "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm" ; fhir:code "F33" ] .

example:MemoryLoss
  a rdfs:Class ;
  rdfs:label "Memory Loss" ;
  rdfs:comment "A condition characterized by the inability to recall past events or learn new information" ;
  fhir:code [ fhir:system "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10-cm" ; fhir:code "R41.3" ] .

example:BidirectionalRelationship
  a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "Bidirectional Relationship" ;
  rdfs:comment "A relationship where two concepts influence each other" .

example:Depression example:hasEffect example:MemoryLoss .
example:MemoryLoss example:hasEffect example:Depression .

example:hasEffect
  a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "Has Effect" ;
  rdfs:comment "A relationship where one concept affects another" .

example:AcceleratedMemoryLoss
  a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "Accelerated Memory Loss" ;
  rdfs:comment "A condition where memory loss is accelerated" ;
  example:hasEffect example:Depression .

example:HigherLevelOfDepressiveSymptoms
  a rdf:Property ;
  rdfs:label "Higher Level of Depressive Symptoms" ;
  rdfs:comment "A condition where depressive symptoms are exacerbated" ;
  example:hasEffect example:MemoryLoss .
```

In this representation, we have defined the following concepts:

* `example:Depression`: a class representing the concept of depression
* `example:MemoryLoss`: a class representing the concept of memory loss
* `example:BidirectionalRelationship`: a property representing the bidirectional relationship between depression and memory loss
* `example:hasEffect`: a property representing the effect of one concept on another
* `example:AcceleratedMemoryLoss`: a property representing the accelerated memory loss effect of depression
* `example:HigherLevelOfDepressiveSymptoms`: a property representing the higher level of depressive symptoms effect of memory loss

We have also defined the relationships between these concepts using the `example:hasEffect` property. The `example:BidirectionalRelationship` property is used to represent the bidirectional relationship between depression and memory loss.

The `fhir:code` properties are used to map the concepts to ICD-10 codes.
